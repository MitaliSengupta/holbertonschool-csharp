    -   Based on 1-dog, add a constructor to struct Dog that takes parameters.

-   [3-dog](https://github.com/MitaliSengupta/holbertonschool-csharp/tree/master/0x05-csharp-structs_enums/3-dog)
    -   Based on 2-dog, override the .ToString() method to print the Dog objectâ€™s attributes to stdout.
